# My-Green-Background
This is a website as a part of step 5 of CodeYourFuture ITD project. The website is related to my interest towards environment, and how it has been shaped in the first place.<br>
I tried to write this project in an accessible way. This has been applied in the choice of colours, fonts, and alt for images. The website has been tested by Narrator screen reader.
